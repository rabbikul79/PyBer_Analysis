# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

A project to create a script using Panda to analyze data for Pyber ride sharing company. Using the city_data.csv and ride_data .csv files a summery report needs to be created to show various metrics regarding ride, fare and driver for 3 types of citie - Urban, Suburban and Rural. Also a line chart needs to be produced to display total weekly fares for each city tyoe.

## Results:

1. As displayed on the below image the summery report shows the Rural city has the highest average fare per driver, ride but the total total fare is only 10% and total number of rides only 7.6% comparing to the Urban cities. The suburban cities holds 27% of the  total amount of rides and contribute 30% of the total fares. Even though Urban cities generates most number of rides and most revenue but because of the number of driver the average fare per driver is low.

## Summary

In summery it can be said the suburban cities is the growing market and the company should put more focus for growth as the number of rides is still low comparing the average fare per ride. The urban citis is market has reached to the peak and the rural citis will need some more time for the consumer to adopt the rdie sharing concept.
